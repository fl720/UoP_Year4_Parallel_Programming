# UoP_Year4_Parallel_Programming
This is Year4 Parallel Programming practice and coursework source code. Using Java to study different behaviour and properties of different parallel programming approches. 

From : 
* Multicore Mode
* MPJ (Cluster Mode)
* GPU (Using Aparapi)

Folder **PP** contains all practices after each lecture. Folder **mini project** contains all the materials for the coursework.

## PP
Exercise in various topics to discuss and dicover the ability and limitation in each parallel programming methods. 

* lecture 01: calculating π uisng numerical approch in both sequential and parallel (multi-threads) to work out the performace of calculating under different thread numbers(1,2,4,8).
* lecture 02: calculating Mandelbrot set and plot them. Discussed how different decomposition methods (workload) will affect the efficiency.
* lecture 03: simulation of Convey Game of Life. Discovered approches in updating data and calculating data. Introduced method to hold threads before updating all the data.
* lecture 04: using Laplace equation, to further discuss the effects of hold threads before updating and idea of boundry.
